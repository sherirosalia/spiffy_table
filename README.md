# spiffy_table
Single page table template using php, mysql, PDO, bootstrap html and a touch of javascript and ajax. 
This is the first commit. I'm using PDO for the connection mechanism, a bootstrap hover table displaying a list of odd facts and a modal to gather updates to the table information. 
Delete buttons work using ajax. I have not finished working on the update script. After completion of update, I'll do an insert modal as well.
